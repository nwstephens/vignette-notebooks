## Notebook Source and Output

- Notebook source code is an R Markdown (`.Rmd`) file

- Notebooks have an associated HTML file (`.nb.html`):
    - Includes `.Rmd` source code and output
    - Created automatically by RStudio IDE when `html_notebook` Rmd is saved
    - Can also be created from the command line via `rmarkdown::html_notebook` format

- RStudio IDE will provide a special diff view of notebook HTML files that enables users to clearly see changes in both source code and output

- Notebooks can also be rendered into *any other* R Markdown format
